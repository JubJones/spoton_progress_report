The use case diagram (Figure \ref{fig:use-case-diagram}) illustrates the interactions between different user roles (actors) and the core functionalities (use cases) of the SpotOn Multi-Camera Tracking System. The actors, shown on the left side of the diagram, represent the primary user groups interacting with the system:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Security Officer:} Interacts with tracking, maintaining tracking through gaps, and prioritizing specific individuals.
    \item \textbf{Facility Manager:} Primarily interacts with visualizing movement paths.
    \item \textbf{Analytics Specialist:} Also interacts with visualizing movement paths for analysis.
    \item \textbf{Emergency Coordinator:} Interacts with prioritizing the tracking of specific individuals during critical events.
\end{itemize}
This diagram provides a high-level overview of who uses the system and for what main purposes.

\section{User Interface Design}
\label{section:user-interface-design}

The user interface for the multi-camera tracking system is designed to offer a clear, intuitive, and efficient experience for security personnel, facility managers, and other stakeholders, focusing on retrospective analysis of recorded video feeds.  The interface prioritizes the visualization of movement patterns, easy access to detailed tracking information.

    \label{fig:mockup-group-view-expanded}
\end{figure}
\clearpage

The user interface presents an intuitive flow across multiple views as illustrated in the mockups. The Landing Page (Figure \ref{fig:mockup-landing-page}) offers users a choice between campus and factory views, followed by a date selection interface (Figure \ref{fig:mockup-landing-page-datetime}) to access specific video feed timeframes. Once a selection is made, the Group View Page (Figure \ref{fig:mockup-group-view}) displays all cameras with detected individuals, presenting a comprehensive map that visualizes tracking paths and shows detection counts per camera. This page features multiple tabs, including an overview tab showing all camera feeds simultaneously and individual tabs for specific views. For more detailed analysis, the Expanded Group View (Figure \ref{fig:mockup-group-view-expanded}) displays camera feeds with identification markers for each detected person, listing cropped images of all detected individuals below the video feed. Users can select specific individuals to focus tracking exclusively on them, viewing detailed information such as position tracking status, coordinates, confidence levels, timestamps, first detection time, current tracking duration, and movement analysis.

\section{Target and Development System}
\label{section:development-system}

\subsection{Data Preparation}
\label{subsection:data-preparation-system}
% In order to prepare data for KU Eater, proper tooling is needed both for data storage and retrieval. The following list is the technologies we used in data preparation:

% \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=80pt]
%     \item \textbf{Google Sheets:} In order to record interview results such as stall information, list of menu items, we decided to use Google Sheets as our storage for raw data\footnote{The spreadsheet containing the data: \url{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oQ_PykNVvtV5KKtKOrva9aiZeK4S42EuFP9S6qaO4cg}}.
%     The advantage of this tool is that we have faster access to data, especially when we are doing interviews with data holders.
%     \item \textbf{PostgreSQL:} PostgreSQL is a relational database system, one of the advantages that PostgreSQL offers is the synchronous replication, we can use that feature in order to separate between the master data store, and sandbox database for training ML models.
%     PostgreSQL is used as our main datastore. PostgreSQL also has vector support for AI-driven applications.
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Recommendation Engine}
% \label{subsection:recommendation-engine}
% KU Eater at its core features a recommendation system, in order to build a consistent and fast service, we chose the following technologies:

% \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=80pt]
%     \item \textbf{gRPC:} A high performant protocol to do Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) that allows us to share schemas between
%     services. This allows for consistent data throughout the application's scope and predictable behavior.
%     \item \textbf{Tonic:} A gRPC server based on the Rust programming language. It is performant and can be
%     used to serve data asynchronously for a near real-time experience.
%     \item \textbf{PostgreSQL:} Like in the step of Data Preparation (\ref{subsection:data-preparation-system}), we can use replication to our advantage to update data in real-time
%     both from autonomous systems or administrator edits.
% \end{itemize}


% \subsection{Web Application}
% \label{subsection:web-application}
% KU Eater as a web-based mobile application, needs an interface designed with a target of mobile phone users in mind.
% In order to complement our requirements, our approach to the development process of the application must be mobile-first.
% The following is the technology stack of KU Eater web application:

% \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=80pt]
%     \item \textbf{React Native:} React Native is a framework based on React that offers powerful data fetching functionalities, built-in caching using existing web technologies etc. \\
%     The framework is native to Javascript, and can ensure its compatibility across devices. It is used as our frontend for the application and a mediator between the backend.
% \end{itemize}
