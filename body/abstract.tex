In surveillance and security environments, tracking individuals across multiple camera views presents significant challenges that impact response times and resource allocation. The Intelligent Multi-Camera Person Tracking and Analytics System addresses these limitations through an AI-powered solution designed to identify, track, and analyze individuals across distributed camera networks. Our project responds to the critical need for automated person tracking that eliminates the manual effort of monitoring multiple video feeds simultaneously. The system integrates three core features: LLM-powered person selection using natural language descriptions, real-time person detection with re-identification across camera transitions, and comprehensive path tracking with visualization on dynamic maps. We evaluate the effectiveness of our solution using the MMPTrack dataset, which provides standardized multi-camera scenarios for both training and testing our models. This approach allows us to demonstrate the system's capabilities in controlled environments before deployment in real-world settings. The system's implementation shows significant enhancements in surveillance capabilities, particularly for law enforcement agencies requiring efficient person tracking in complex environments. We expect our project to improve operational efficiency and situational awareness for security personnel while reducing cognitive load and manual monitoring requirements.
